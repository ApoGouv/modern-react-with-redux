This is the tutorial you've been looking for to master modern web development with React.

**Redux?** We got it. **ES6/Babel?** Covered. **Webpack?** Included! 

Mastering React and Redux can get you a position in web development or help you build that personal project you've been dreaming of. It's a skill that will put you more in demand in the modern web development industry, especially with the release of Redux and ReactNative.

This course will get you up and running quickly, and teach you the core knowledge you need to deeply understand and build React components and structure applications with Redux.

We'll start by mastering the fundamentals of React, including JSX, “props", “state", and eventing. Source code is provided for each lecture, so you will always stay up-to-date with the course pacing. After an introduction to React, we'll dive right in to Redux, covering topics like reducers, actions, and the state tree.

If you are new to React and Redux, or if you've been working to learn it but sometimes feel like you still don't quite 'get it', this is the React course for you! To learn React you have to understand it.

- Learn how to use React's custom markup language, JSX, to clean up your Javascript code
- Master the process of breaking down a complex component into many smaller, interchangeable components
- Grasp the difference between “props" and “state" and when to use each
- Develop complex applications that scale in complexity by mastering Redux
- Dive deeper into Redux by using middlewares. No fancy terms required!
